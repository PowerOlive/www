      <a href=""><span data-localize="QUESTION_2">What makes Lantern unique?</span> <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
    <div class="answer">
      <p data-localize="ANSWER_2_A">Lantern is unique because it uses a variety of techniques to stay unblocked in censored regions around the world, falling back to other approaches if some of those techniques are blocked. The developer team at Lantern is constantly adapting and revising those techniques depending on the blocking environment. User feedback are also integral parts of Lantern, with new releases incorporating suggestions and addressing concerns.</p>

  <div class="question">
      <a href=""><span data-localize="QUESTION_7">Does Lantern give me anonymity online?</span><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
    <div class="answer">
      <p data-localize="ANSWER_7_A">Lantern is designed to provide you with unfettered access to information online. Lantern is not an anonymity tool, so if you need or would like to be anonymous online, please use <a href="https://torproject.org" target="_blank">Tor</a>. Otherwise, Lantern will give you faster access to blocked sites.</p>

  <div class="question">
      <a href=""><span data-localize="QUESTION_8">What is the difference between Lantern and Lantern Pro?</span>
 <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span data-localize="ANSWER_8_A">Lantern Pro is built on the same improved Lantern technology, but is faster, more blocking resistant and has unlimited high-speed data.</span><br><br>  
        <span data-localize="ANSWER_8_B">Faster: Pro allocates less users per server, thereby giving users improved performance. Furthermore, Pro uses different servers than Free.</span><br><br>  
<span data-localize="ANSWER_8_C">Blocking resistant: Lantern Pro is more blocking resistant because Censors can’t identify the servers unless they also have Pro. Also, Lantern Pro employs Smart Servers so if one server is not performing, the user is transferred to another, ensuring steady connection. This allows for improved defense against censor interference with your connection. The Lantern dev team works on a 24 hour schedule to be able to identify blocking techniques by censors and respond
    quickly to ensure that any users experiencing blocking are online as soon as possible.</span><br><br>  
<span data-localize="ANSWER_8_D">Unlimited Data: Lantern Pro doesn’t limit data usage, so that those that are reliant on a fast unblocked connection can access all their online content and information whenever they need.</span>
<br><br>
<span data-localize="ANSWER_8_E">To switch from the free version to Lantern Pro, just download Lantern and click on the upgrade button within the interface.</span></p>

  <div class="question">
      <a href=""><span data-localize="QUESTION_9">Why do I have to pay for Lantern Pro?</span>
 <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
    <div class="answer">
      <p data-localize="ANSWER_9_A">The payment feature makes Lantern more blocking resistant because censors cannot infiltrate or block Lantern Pro without paying, which gives you, the user, more stability.  We’ve offered Lantern Pro at a competitive price to help us stay around to continue to provide the fastest and most blocking resistant way to get you online. </p>

  <div class="question">
      <a href=""><span data-localize="QUESTION_12">Why does Lantern have a data bandwidth limit?</span>  <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></a>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span data-localize="ANSWER_12_A">As Lantern users continue to grow, costs of maintaining it increase significantly each month. In order to stick around and keep building and innovating for our users, we need to support our operations by charging a small fee.</span><br><br>
        <span data-localize="ANSWER_12_B">To keep our free version running, we implemented a bandwidth limitation of 800 MB/ month.. When the bandwidth limit is reached, the connection is slowed down and Free users are prompted to upgrade to Lantern Pro.</span></p>
